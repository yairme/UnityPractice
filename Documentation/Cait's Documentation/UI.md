# Idea
Buttons that increase/decrease bouncy thingamajig speed.

# How
Script with a couple imgui buttons attached to the thingamajig itself. When clicked, said buttons modify the velocity component of the thingamajig

# Feature
The feature adds a script component that adds a few buttons to the screen. When clicked, they modify the velocity of the component they are attached to.

*PS: definitely a hacky solution, doing enterprise grade UI work is not something I am in the mood for.*
