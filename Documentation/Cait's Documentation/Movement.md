# Idea
Simple velocity component to control 2d movement.

# How
I can just add a custom script with a backing vec2 to represent velocity, then just multiply by deltatime and add to the translation.

# Feature
The feature just has a velocity component implemented. In the case of the scene with the square, the velocity is set to `<1, 0>`.
