# UnityPractice

### Tasks
- Install Unity version 2022.3.21f1
- Make 3 features of a game.
- Use 3 Branches of GitHub for each feature.
- Document the features.

## Unity Version

This is the version that these projects are using, if you don't have it installed you can't add them to your unity hub.

## The Features

- 2D Movement
- UI Manager 
- Collision Detection

### 2D Movement

All that is needed for this one a script or set of scripts (Up to you) that will get a 2D object in Unity move, that is all, how it moves in what direction, in whatever direction, that is up to you.

### UI Manager

For this feature I want to see you manipulation some UI components, what it does it's up to you, it can display something or even move, doesn't matter.  
  
### Collision Detection

This one I want you to understand and experiment with Unity colliders, I want you to interact with them and that something happens when they are use, can be stopping from moving, or activating something.

## Branches

If you haven't looked around the Github yet, you can see that there are already 3 Branches made, one for each of you, you will then start working there, from there you will then create a branch extending from that branch, this is how we will keep you guys from fucking over your other stuff, you are allowed to make as many branches as you want, but they have to be from your branch, also your branch won't be allowed to be merged into the Main until I checked them through a pull request that you all will have to make to be able to merge your branch to main.

## Documentation  
  
I want 3 type of documentation.  

1. Your Idea, what do you plan on making.
2. How are you planning on making it.  
3. What does your feature do, and how does it work.

These documentations are done for each one of your features and saved inside the Documentation folder.

## Conclusion & Goal

This is a test to see what you know of Unity, and make you plan out and search more about Unity, by setting a goal you will have a reason to start doing this, in the end with this we can then see how we each do our programming, how we write our code, then with this we can make actual team documentation when we make a video game together.
